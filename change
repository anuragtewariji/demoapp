Labeling Taxonomy and Approval Workflow for Event Promotion

The Labeling Taxonomy functionality is a crucial part of managing content, events, or products within a structured system. It involves assigning labels or tags to different categories, making it easier to organize, search, and classify items according to predefined taxonomies. These labels, however, must go through an approval process before they are allowed for promotion to higher environments, ensuring that the content or event meets organizational standards, consistency, and relevance.

This workflow ensures that only validated and approved labels are pushed for promotion, reducing errors, maintaining quality, and aligning content with business goals.

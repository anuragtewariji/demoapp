Implementing a structured promotion logic that utilizes taxonomy to seamlessly transition software artifacts from Development (Dev) to Quality Assurance (QA) environments can significantly enhance deployment efficiency and application availability. By organizing artifacts under specific labels and automating their promotion, organizations can ensure that only thoroughly tested and approved components reach higher environments, thereby maintaining system integrity and performance.
